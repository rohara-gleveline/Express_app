##Technologies Used
CSS, Express, React, GitHub Jobs API

##General Approach

The team started by wireframing the app and figuring out all of the express routes and react components that would be needed to achieve MVP. Once everything was planned and user stories were uploaded to trello, the team began assigning back-end routes to different team members. 

Each member was responsible for creating the controller and models needed for each route. Once all back-end routes were complete we merged on the master branch and began assigning React components to team members. 

At this time, certain members continued trying to find viable APIs to add additional information into the App, however, we were not able to add any other APIs except GiHub Jobs. 

As the react components were being finalized, team members split up styling responsibilities by component and began styling CSS. 

As the App became more and more complete, team members worked in conjunction with each other to solve bugs like fixing GitHub issues, updating styling, fixing create job issues, etc. 

##Installation instructions for any dependencies

##Your user stories – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
Casual-Browser: As  a  user,  I  want  an  easy  job search tool that allows me to search jobs posted on GitHub jobs so I can easily look for positions that I may be interested in. 

Power-Browser: As  a  user,  I  want  a  job  search tool  that  not  only  allows  me  to  search  but  also save jobs posted on GitHub jobs to my profile so I can keep track of current openings. 

Power-User:  As  a  user,  I  want  a  job  search  tool that  allows  me  to  not  only  search  and  save posting  on  GitHub  jobs,  but  also  add  postings I’ve  found  elsewhere  with  relevant  information to  me  such  as  my  point  of  contact,  date  of  last contact, date of application and more!

##Descriptions of any unsolved problems or hurdles your team had to overcome
- GitHub continued to give us issues including unknown error messages and information that was not up to date.
- Originally another API was going to be used for salary information but because it only rendered data half of the time and made the search results appear minutes after submitted the API was removed.
- Working with multiple fields in one table.
